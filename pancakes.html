        <h2>Pancakes</h2>
        <img src="https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PERFECT-Best-Fluffy-Pancakes-IMAGE-450.jpg" alt="Pancakes"width="400">
        <p>Every single Sunday begins with pancakes… and ends with leftover pancakes from the morning. These are everything you want in a pancake. They’re soft and so fluffy… each mouthful melts in your mouth… you’ll be reaching for more than one. Stack. Possibly.
<p><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p> 2 cups all purpose flour
        <p> 1/4 cup granulated sugar
            <p>4 teaspoons baking powder
                <p>1/4 teaspoon baking soda
                    <p>1/2 teaspoon salt
                        <p>1 3/4 cups milk
                            <p>1/4 cups butter
                                <p>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
                                    <p>1 large eggs
<h2> Instructions:</h2>
    <p>1. Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
        <p>2. Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
        (The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).
        <p>3. Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 
        <p>4. Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.
        <p>5. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
        <p>6. Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!
