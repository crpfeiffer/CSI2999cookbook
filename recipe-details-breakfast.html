Once the cooking surface is hot, add the ground breakfast sausage to the pan or griddle and break it up with a spatula as you cook it. Cook the sausage for 6 to 7 minutes until it is browned and cooked through. Remove the sausage from the pan and set it aside. Salt the hash browns with 2 teaspoons of the salt and add it to the hot griddle pan too cook in the remaining grease from the sausage. Add additional oil if needed. Cook the hash browns according to directions on package. Make sure to get a nice golden crust on them! While the hash browns are cooking, heat a separate pan over medium heat. Add ¼ teaspoon of salt to the eggs. Once the pan is hot, add the butter and pour the beaten eggs in. Slowly stir the eggs with a spatula to create curds. If the egg starts cooking too quickly, turn the temperature down slightly. Continue to slowly stir the eggs until they are cooked through and set them aside. To assemble the burrito, layer ¼ cup of the spinach onto the tortilla followed by 1/10 of the hashbrowns (about ⅓ cup cooked), 1/10 of the breakfast sausage (about ¼ cup cooked), 1/10 of the scrambled egg (about ¼ cup cooked), ¼ cup of grated cheese and top with ¼ teaspoon of the bagel seasoning. Basically, you are going to divide up each of the ingredients evenly amongst the 8 tortillas. Once you have layered the ingredients onto the tortilla, fold two ends of the tortilla in and roll the tortilla to form a burrito. Wrap the burrito tightly in the freezer paper and again in the aluminum foilTo serve, remove the foil and freezer paper and reheat in the microwave.Store burritos in the freezer for up to 3 months or the refrigerator up to 5 days.</p>');

Once frozen, add the milk and yogurt to the bowl of a large, high-speed blender with a tamper (see notes). Add the frozen blueberries, strawberries, banana, and broken up acai. With the blender on low, use the tamper to push the frozen fruit down, mixing around as much as possible. Continue to blend on low until smooth, only adding additional liquid when needed. Assemble. Divide the smoothie into two bowls and top with all your favorite toppings. Popular additions include sliced banana, nuts, seeds, granola, and berries. Best enjoyed immediately.</p>');

Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well. Repeat this process adding a spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture.( Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure they dont curdle) Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for just 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and set aside. It will thicken as it cools. Stir well and add another splash of cream, if needed, to thin.Fill a medium size pot with about 3 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling. Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the water). Crack one egg into a small cup (I use a measuring cup).  Lower the egg into the simmer water, gently easing it out of the cup. Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft you want your egg yolk. Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon. **It is not abnormal for a white foam to form on top of the water when poaching an egg. You can simple skim the foam off of the water with a spoon. While the egg is cooking, place the slices of Canadian bacon in a large pan and cook on medium-high heat for about 1 minute on each side.Toast the English muffin. Top each toasted side with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, and then a poached egg. Top with hollandaise sauce.</p>');
