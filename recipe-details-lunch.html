Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth.</p>');

Sprinkle a generous amount of grated Parmesan cheese on the buttered side of one slice of bread. Press the Parmesan into the butter so that it sticks.Place slices of mozzarella or your favorite melting cheese on top of the Parmesan-covered bread. Add any optional toppings, such as tomato slices or fresh basil. Place the second slice of bread on top, buttered side facing out. Carefully place the sandwich in the preheated skillet or griddle. Cook on each side until the bread is golden brown, and the cheese is melted and gooey. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes per side. Once both sides are golden and the cheese is melted, remove the sandwich from the pan. Allow it to cool for a moment before slicing.</p>');
